Actually, reading a file is easy
* Markdown should be doable, but it's a rabbit hole
* There are other rabbit holes I want to explore first

What's next
* Slowly build up an editor?
* Will investigate "prior art" after batch, surely vim/emacs have plugins for this?
* Investigate iTerm, other protocols that allow display of images
* Investigate plug-ins for transitions
