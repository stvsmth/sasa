Actually, reading a file is easy
* Markdown should be doable, but it's a rabbit hole
* There are other rabbit holes I want to explore first

What's next
* Introduce slide navigation (backward/forward)
* Slowly build up an editor?
* Actually parse content. Choose MD & tweak? Custom format?
  * Maybe, eventually agnostic ... yaml, json, etc
* Will investigate "prior art" after batch, surely vim/emacs have tools like?
* Investigate iTerm, other protocols that allow display of images
* Investigate plug-ins for transitions

Other
* Automatically overflow text onto new slide (with `cont'd` header)
* Make char used to draw string2ascii an option
