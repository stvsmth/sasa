Use Markdown to present in the terminal

## Motivation

None. Just seems like a fun way to play around in Rust. Excellent dog food quotient.

## Will this work

Not any time soon. Major issues:

* Most annoying, hanging indents (should be easy, let's pair)
* Images are ... maybe
* Transitions ... ??

# COOL

Insert cool transition effect here

## Transitions

* That was one of the few, "Hey, I have a neat idea" ideas that actually played out
* Would love some kind of plugin system so folks could just riff on transitions
* Ideas:
  * Matrix like "Raining into form"
  * 80s style of cursor scooting from left-to-right
  * Other movie tropes of computing that never existed

# THE END

Because I don't get tired of that!
